# Welcome to Stellar Developer Docs

Stellar is a layer-1 open-source, decentralized, peer-to-peer blockchain network that provides a framework for developers to create applications, issue assets, write smart contracts, and connect to existing financial rails. Stellar is designed to enable creators, innovators, and developers to build projects on the network that can interoperate with each other.

The developer docs will teach you how to build applications, issue and use tokens, write smart contracts, set up on and off-ramps, set up a validator node, and more.

If you can’t find answers to your questions in the docs, search for your answer or ask questions in our [Stellar Developer Discord](https://discord.gg/stellardev) or [Stack Exchange](https://stellar.stackexchange.com/).

## Stellar wayfinding based on audience type

There's much more you can do with the Stellar network than what's listed below! These pathfinding guides are meant to give you an idea of how to get started navigating the docs in finding necessary conceptual information, tutorials, data availability recommendations, and more based on what you're trying to accomplish.
